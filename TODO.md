# TODO

(in no particular order)

* Documentation, more documentation and even more documentation!
* Sample scenes to show basic application configuration
* Cleanup and optimize DataCollectionAnimatedPresenter
* Add grid support for DataCollectionAnimatedPresenter (nicer animations of moving elements)
* Add new animation type for resizing (not scaling) RectTransforms, can be usefull for popup menu or drop down boxes
* Add more transition options for sliding mode (move only new/old presenter)
* Panel Canvas/CanvasGroup should start deactivated
* ToastManager should store list in presenter (don't accumulate in model if no presenter is bound)
* Add animation support for ToolTipManager
* Add some form of blocking (i.e. some new window should deactivate all layers below)
